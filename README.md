# WMrem

WMrem is a pdf watermark remover that i made because i needed.

might(probably) be (is) full of bugs

# Updates:

V1.0.0: files were created

V1.0.1:BetterInpage now has a way to detect repeated images(So you can remove those full-screen watermarks!)


## Installation

A)Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and requirements.txt

1-open cmd in the folder(by going to it and writing cmd in folder path bar)(or using cd)

2-use requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
OR

B)install packages by hand

1-open cmd anywhere you want
2-open requirements.txt and install every package using:
```bash
pip install [name of the package+version]
```


## info
Upcleaner is supposed to remove a color in selected box, Inpage is for cleaning everywhere a color is detected, BetterInpage is supposed to be better version of inpage, idk if it's that better or not

## Usage

- with visual studio:open main.py,click on f5(or fn+f5), select python debugger, the rest is obvious
-----
- with cmd:open cmd in the folder(by going to it and writing cmd in folder path bar)(or using cd),write:
```bash
python main.py
```
(works for all three)
